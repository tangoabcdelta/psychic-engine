## Pagination

Below you can find an example implementation of pagination using `use-comments`.

  style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom: 25px;"
  title="use-comments-pagination"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

## Comments with approval

In your Hasura app you can see that there's column `hidden` in the `comments`
table. By default this value is set to `false` meaning that after adding a
comment it will be automatically visible for other people. You can change it to
`true` and then all the comments would need to be manually approved before being
publicly visible. To do this we need to go to `Modify` section of the `comments`
table:

<img width="700" src="./hidden.png" />

If `hidden` is set to true, newly added comments are going to have status
`delivered-awaiting-approval` and won't be visible for other users. To approve
them you'd need to edit a particular row and set value of `hidden` to `false`.

## Send an email after receiving a new comment

It would be cool if there were some notifications after receiving a new comment,
right? I have good news! With Hasura it's very straightforward. You can use
`Data Triggers`. A Data Trigger will capture insert events on a specified table
and then call a webhook that can carry out any custom logic. In this case this
custom logic would be sending an email.

You can read more about Data Triggers
[here](https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/manual/event-triggers/create-trigger.html).

An example webhook which sends email implemented with
[Express](https://expressjs.com/).

```js
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: process.env.SMTP_SERVICE,
  host: process.env.SMTP_HOST,
  port: process.env.SMTP_PORT,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.SMTP_LOGIN,
    pass: process.env.SMTP_PASSWORD,
  },
});

app.set('port', process.env.PORT || 3000);
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post('/send-email', function (req, res) {
  const comment = req.body.event.data.new;

  const mailOptions = {
    from: process.env.SMTP_LOGIN,
    to: process.env.SMTP_LOGIN,
    subject: 'You have a new comment!',
    text: `New comment: ${JSON.stringify(comment)}`,
  };

  transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, function (error, info) {
    if (error) {
      console.log(error);
      return;
    }
    res.json({ success: true });
  });
});

app.listen(app.get('port'), function () {
  console.log('Server started on: ' + app.get('port'));
});
```
