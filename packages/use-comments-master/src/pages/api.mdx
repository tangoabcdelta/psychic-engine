# API Reference

## `useComments`

Fetches comments from Hasura backend specified in `hasuraUrl` on mount and
whenever `config.limit` or `config.offset` change.

### Parameters

- **hasuraUrl**: URL of your Hasura instance. Your comments will be stored
  there.
- **postId**: Comments will be fetched for the post with identifier `postId`
- **config**: Configurable offset and limit for the GraphQL query to Hasura. See
  [`UseCommentsConfig`](#use-comments-config)

### TypeScript Signature

```ts
const useComments: (
  hasuraUrl: string,
  postId: string,
  config?: UseCommentsConfig | undefined
) => UseComentsResult;
```

### Returns `UseComentsResult`

```ts
interface UseComentsResult {
  comments: Comment[];
  addComment: ({
    content,
    author,
  }: Pick<Comment, 'content' | 'author'>) => void;
  refetch: () => void;
  count: number;
  loading: boolean;
  error: UseCommentsError | null;
}
```

## `Comment`

```ts
export interface Comment {
  post_id: string;
  author: string;
  content: string;
  created_at: string;
  status?: CommentStatus;
}
```

## `UseCommentsConfig`

Allows to implement pagination for the comments.
[Learn more about implementing pagination](recipes/#pagination).

```ts
export interface UseCommentsConfig {
  limit?: number;
  offset?: number;
}
```

## `CommentStatus`

When user is adding a new comment it will be in one of four states:

- `sending` — add comment request is still pending.
- `added` — the comment was successfully added and is visible for other people.
- `delivered-awaiting-approval` — the comment was successfully added, but it's
  not yet visible for other people. You can make comments to require approval
  before being visible to others. Read more about it
  [here](recipes/#comments-with-approval).
- `failed` — adding a comment was unsuccessful.

```ts
export declare type CommentStatus =
  | 'sending'
  | 'added'
  | 'delivered-awaiting-approval'
  | 'failed';
```

## `UseCommentsError`

```ts
interface UseCommentsError {
  error: string;
  details: string;
}
```
