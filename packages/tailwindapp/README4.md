Generate a Tailwind config file for your project using the Tailwind CLI utility included when you install the tailwindcss npm package:

    npx tailwindcss init

#### Using a different file name

To use a name other than tailwind.config.js, pass it as an argument on the command-line:

npx tailwindcss init tailwindcss-config.js
