##### **`launch.json`**

Currently it is not possible to have one global `launch.json` file which would be used everywhere, but what works is to add a "launch" object inside your user settings (preferences > user settings). This way it will be shared across all your work spaces

**Example:**

launch config directly in your user settings file, as described [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18401#issuecomment-272400316).
