# Is there a standard function to check for null, undefined, or blank variables in JavaScript?

Is there a universal JavaScript function that checks that a variable has a value and ensures that it's not `undefined` or `null`? I've got this code, but I'm not sure if it covers all cases:

    function isEmpty(val){
        return (val === undefined || val == null || val.length <= 0) ? true : false;
    }
    
    
You can just check if the *variable* has a `truthy` value or not. That means

    if( value ) {
    }

will evaluate to `true` if `value` is **not**:

 - null
 - undefined
 - NaN
 - empty string ("")
 - 0
 - false

The above list represents all possible `falsy` values in ECMA-/Javascript. Find it in the [specification][1] at the `ToBoolean` section.

Furthermore, if you do not **know** whether a variable exists (that means, if it was *declared*) you should check with the `typeof` operator. For instance

    if( typeof foo !== 'undefined' ) {
        // foo could get resolved and it's defined
    }

If you can be sure that a *variable* is declared at least, you should directly check if it has a `truthy` value like shown above.

The verbose method to check if value is undefined or null is:

    return value === undefined || value === null;

You can also use the `==` operator but this expects one to [know all the rules][1]:

    return value == null; // also returns true if value is undefined


  [1]: http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.9.3





    function isEmpty(value){
      return (value == null || value.length === 0);
    }

This will return true for

    undefined  // Because undefined == null

    null

    []

    ""

and zero argument functions since a function's `length` is the number of declared parameters it takes.

To disallow the latter category, you might want to just check for blank strings

    function isEmpty(value){
      return (value == null || value === '');
    }
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
This is the safest check and I haven't seen it posted here exactly like that:

    if (typeof value !== 'undefined' && value) {
        //deal with value'
    };

It will cover cases where **value** was never defined, and also any of these:

 - null
 - undefined (value of undefined is not the same as a parameter that was never defined)
 - 0
 - "" (empty string)
 - false
 - NaN

You may find the following function useful: 

    function typeOf(obj) {
      return {}.toString.call(obj).split(' ')[1].slice(0, -1).toLowerCase();
    }

Or in ES7 (comment if further improvements)

    function typeOf(obj) {
      const { toString } = Object.prototype;
      const stringified = obj::toString();
      const type = stringified.split(' ')[1].slice(0, -1);
          
      return type.toLowerCase();
    }

Results:

    typeOf(); //undefined
    typeOf(null); //null
    typeOf(NaN); //number
    typeOf(5); //number
    typeOf({}); //object
    typeOf([]); //array
    typeOf(''); //string
    typeOf(function () {}); //function
    typeOf(/a/) //regexp
    typeOf(new Date()) //date
    typeOf(new WeakMap()) //weakmap
    typeOf(new Map()) //map

The first answer with best rating is wrong. If value is undefined it will throw an exception in modern browsers. You have to use: 

    if (typeof(value) !== "undefined" && value)

or 

    if (typeof value  !== "undefined" && value)
    
    
    
And sometimes
This condition check


    if (!!foo) {
        //foo is defined
    }


is all you need.



A solution I like a lot:

Let's define that a blank variable is `null`, or `undefined`, or if it has length, it is zero, or if it is an object, it has no keys:

    function isEmpty (value) {
      return (
        // null or undefined
        (value == null) ||

        // has length and it's zero
        (value.hasOwnProperty('length') && value.length === 0) ||

        // is an Object and has no keys
        (value.constructor === Object && Object.keys(value).length === 0)
      )
    }

Returns:

- **true:** `undefined`, `null`, `""`, `[]`, `{}`
- **false:** `true`, `false`, `1`, `0`, `-1`, `"foo"`, `[1, 2, 3]`, `{ foo: 1 }`
