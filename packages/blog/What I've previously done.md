# Best Practices Implementation

The format will be:

- **best practice statement** *\<insert what you should be ideally doing>*
	- **previously,** *\<insert what I've done or followed previously>*
	- **this time,** *\<insert process how and what I wish to do better right now>*





### Prose

-  Discuss and determine the best ***design pattern***
  - Previously, it used to be  self-made-decision on the fly, without any thinking process or adherence to guidelines, either ending up in a sub-par pattern or mostly a non-pattern
  - This time, I wish to do it better - Let's discuss, or pass on messages to each other, at least for 5 minutes
    - If there is a data-structure to be followed, even if it is a simple array, let's call it out
  
- Approach Discussion

  - Previously, I used to trust people and leave it up to them to determine it
  -  This time, before starting our work:
     - Let's spend anywhere between 5 to 15 minutes (not more) on approach discussion. Sometimes we'll have a brilliant approach. But sometimes we'll be totally clueless. 

- Design the story book first, component later
  
  - Previously, I used to either not worry about the re-use of components
  - This time, I wish to build re-usable  components first, put them up on the story board and them build the component I'll be working for.
  
- Code Reviews

  - Previously, I used to do it daily in a reserved time
  -  This time, I wish to do it once a week to determine the lapses
     - It isn't possible to do code-reviews when we are moving really fast.
     -   We learn a problem statement on Tuesday and have to get this thing out of the window & ship it before 4PM Thursday. It barely leaves any room for discussion on Wednesday. So, let's do it on ***Monday***, as the proverbial *"[retro](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective)"* & do the following:
        -  During the Sprint Retrospective, the team discusses:
           - What went well in the Sprint
           - What could be improved - *determine the mistakes, the the tech debts*
           - What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint - *the do-able target*
     - Unlike the recommended duration, considering the head-count, we can keep it as short as 30 minutes without any problems I think.

- Adhere to "Deep Work" philosophy

  - What is "Deep Work" - A term defined & made popular by Author Cal Newport with his book *"Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World"* where he describes - how human cognitive energy is limited, how our pathetic attempts at multi-tasking and hyper-productivity ends up in mediocre results, how we are most-distracted - (will share the podcast details and links for the audio book later, hearing beyond first 15 minutes of the book won't be required to understand the concept).

  - Previously, sessions for deep-work and shallow-work were inter-mingled

  - This time, I intend to reserve a dedicated-uninterrupted 2 to 4 hour duration each day when I'll do deep work as it isn't possible to do deep work while collaborating with others or answering queries / emails / text messages etc.
