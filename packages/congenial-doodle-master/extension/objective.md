	* save all of the interesting articles, videos, cooking recipes, song lyrics, or whatever else you come across while browsing. With one click, Instapaper lets you save, read, and manage the things you find on the Internet.
	* More than a way to remove distractions for an article, Instapaper is a way to manage your bookmarks and reading list. Heck, it even offers you an iPhone app, a Kindle subscription and an ePub download, meaning you can read your saved articles on practically any device. If you‚Äôve got such a device, you‚Äôll love Instapaper. Even if you don‚Äôt, though, it‚Äôs a pretty great tool for saving articles you want to read later ‚Äì and reading them distraction-free.
