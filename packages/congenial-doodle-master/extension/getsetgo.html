                  that seem irrefutable but prove nothing. Fallacies often seem superficially sound and they far
                  too often retain immense persuasive power even after being clearly exposed
                  as false.&nbsp;Like epidemics, fallacies sometimes "burn through" entire
                  populations, often with the most tragic results, before their power is
                  diminished or lost. Fallacies are not always deliberate, but a good

                  <b>The A Priori Argument (</b>also, Rationalization;
                  Dogmatism, Proof Texting.<b>):
                  </b>A corrupt argument from logos,<b> </b>starting with
                  a given, pre-set belief, dogma, doctrine, scripture
                  verse, "fact" or conclusion and then searching for any
                  reasonable or reasonable-sounding argument to
                  rationalize, defend or justify it. Certain ideologues
                  and religious fundamentalists are proud to use this
                  fallacy as their primary method of "reasoning" and some
                  are even honest enough to say so. E.g., since we know
                  there is no such thing as "evolution," a prime duty of believers is to
                  look for ways to explain away growing evidence, such as
                  is found in DNA, that might suggest otherwise. See also
                  the Argument from Ignorance. The opposite of this
                  fallacy is the Taboo. </p>

                  Profiteering; "Vulture Capitalism," "Wealth is disease,
                  and I am the cure."): A corrupt argument from ethos, arguing
                  that because someone is intellectually slower,
                  physically or emotionally less capable, less ambitious,
                  less aggressive, older or less healthy (or simply
                  more trusting or less lucky) than others, s/he
                  "naturally" deserves less in life and may be freely

                  immediate felt need for money, often involving some form
                  of addiction). This fallacy is a "softer" argumentum ad baculum. When challenged, those who practice this
                  fallacy seem to most often shrug their shoulders and
                  mumble "Life is ruff and you gotta be tuff [<em>sic</em>],"
                  "You gotta do what you gotta do to get ahead in this

                  <strong>Actions have Consequences:</strong>&nbsp; The
                  contemporary fallacy of a person in power falsely
                  describing an imposed punishment or penalty as a
                  "consequence" of another's negative act. E.g.," The
                  consequences of your misbehavior could include
                  suspension or expulsion." A corrupt argument from ethos,
                  arrogating to oneself or to one's rules or laws&nbsp;an ethos
                  of cosmic inevitability, i.e., the ethos of God, Fate,
                  Karma, Destiny or Reality Itself. Illness or food
                  poisoning are likely "consequences" of eating spoiled
                  food, while being "grounded" is a<em> punishment for</em>,
                  not a "consequence," of childhood misbehavior. Freezing to
                  death is a natural "consequence" of going out naked in
                  subzero weather but going to prison is a <em>punishment</em>
                  for bank robbery, not a natural, inevitable or
                  unavoidable "consequence," of robbing a bank.&nbsp; Not
                  to be confused with the Argument from Consequences,
                  which is quite different. See also Blaming the Victim. An opposite fallacy is that of
                  Moral Licensing. </p>

                  <b>The Ad Hominem Argument</b> (also, "Personal attack,"
                  "Poisoning the well"): The fallacy of attempting to
                  refute an argument by attacking the opposition’s
                  intelligence, morals, education, professional qualifications, personal character or reputation, using a corrupted
                  negative argument from ethos. E.g., "That so-called
                  judge;" or "He's so evil that
                  you can't believe anything he says."&nbsp;See also "Guilt by
                  Association." The opposite of this is the "Star Power"
                  fallacy.&nbsp; Another obverse of Ad Hominem is the <strong>
                    Token Endorsement Fallacy</strong>, where, in the words
                  of scholar Lara Bhasin, "Individual A has been accused
                  of anti-Semitism, but Individual B is Jewish and says
                  Individual A is not anti-Semitic, and the implication of
                  course is that we can believe Individual B because,
                  being Jewish, he has special knowledge of anti-
                  Semitism. Or, a presidential candidate is accused of
                  anti-Muslim bigotry, but someone finds a testimony from
                  a Muslim who voted for said candidate, and this is
                  trotted out as evidence against the candidate's
                  bigotry."&nbsp; The same fallacy would apply to a sports
                  team offensively named after a marginalized ethnic
                  group,&nbsp; but which has obtained the endorsement
                  (freely given or paid) of some member, traditional
                  leader or tribal council of that marginalized group so
                  that the otherwise-offensive team name and logo
                  magically become "okay" and nonracist. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

                  <strong>The Affective Fallacy (</strong>also<strong> </strong>
                  The Romantic Fallacy; Emotion over Reflection; "Follow
                  Your Heart"): An extremely common modern fallacy of Pathos, that one's
                  emotions, urges or "feelings" are innate and in every case
                  self-validating, autonomous, and above any human intent
                  or act of will (one's own or others'), and are thus
                  immune to challenge or criticism. (In fact,
                  <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-02/nyu-eac021517.php">
                    researchers now [2017] have robust scientific evidence
                    that emotions are actually cognitive and not innate.</a>) In this fallacy one
                  argues, "I feel it, so it must be true. My feelings are valid, so you have no
                  right to criticize what I say or do, or how I say or do
                  it."&nbsp;This latter is also a fallacy of stasis,
                  confusing a respectful and reasoned response or
                  refutation with personal invalidation, disrespect,
                  prejudice, bigotry, sexism, homophobia or hostility.&nbsp;A
                  grossly sexist form of the Affective Fallacy is the
                  well-known crude fallacy that the phallus "Has no
                  conscience" (also, "A man's gotta do what a man's gotta
                  do;" "Thinking with your other head."), i.e., since (male) sexuality
                  is self-validating and beyond voluntary control what one
                  does with it cannot be controlled either and such
                  actions are not open to
                  criticism, an assertion eagerly embraced and extended
                  beyond the male gender in certain reifications of
                  "Desire" in contemporary academic theory. See also,
                  Playing on Emotion. Opposite to this fallacy is the <strong>
                    Chosen Emotion Fallacy</strong>
                  (thanks to scholar Marc Lawson for identifying this
                  fallacy), in which one falsely claims complete, or at
                  least reliable prior
                  voluntary control over one's own&nbsp; autonomic, "gut
                  level" affective reactions. Closely related if not
                  identical to this
                  last is the ancient fallacy of <strong>
                    Angelism,</strong> falsely claiming that one is capable
                  of "objective" reasoning and judgment without emotion, claiming for
                  oneself a viewpoint of Olympian&nbsp; "disinterested
                  objectivity" or pretending to place oneself far above all
                  personal feelings, temptations or
                  bias. See also, Mortification.</p>

                  <strong>Alphabet Soup:</strong> A corrupt modern implicit
                  fallacy from ethos in which a person inappropriately
                  overuses acronyms, abbreviations, form numbers and
                  arcane insider "shop talk" primarily to prove to an
                  audience that s/he "speaks their language" and is "one
                  of them" and to shut out, confuse or impress outsiders.
                  E.g., "It's not uncommon for a K-12 with ASD to be both
                  GT and LD;" "I had a twenty-minute DX Q-so on 15 with a
                  Zed-S1 and a couple of LU2's even though the QR-Nancy
                  was 10 over S9;"&nbsp;or "I hope I'll keep on seeing my BAQ
                  on my LES until the day I get my DD214."&nbsp;&nbsp; See
                  also, Name Calling.
                  This fallacy has recently become common in media
                  pharmaceutical advertising in the United States, where
                  "Alphabet Soup" is used to create false
                  identification with and to
                  exploit&nbsp; patient groups suffering from specific
                  illnesses or conditions, e.g., "If you have DPC with

                  <strong>Alternative Truth </strong>(also, Alt Facts;
                  Counterknowledge; Disinformation; Information Pollution):<strong> </strong>A newly-famous
                  contemporary fallacy of logos rooted in postmodernism, denying the resilience of
                  facts or truth as such. Writer Hannah Arendt, in her
                  <em>
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Origins-Totalitarianism-Hannah-Arendt/dp/0156701537/">The Origins of Totalitarianism</a></em> (1951) warned that "The
                  ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced
                  Nazi or the dedicated communist, but people for whom the
                  distinction between fact and fiction, true and false, no
                  longer exists." Journalist Leslie Grass (2017) writes in
                  her Blog
                  <a href="http://www.reachoutrecovery.com/the-recovery-daily/trending-now/presenting-alternate-facts-is-gaslighting">
                    Reachoutrecovery.com</a>, "Is there someone in your life
                  who insists things happened that didn’t happen, or has a
                  completely different version of events in which you have
                  the facts? It’s a form of mind control and is very
                  common among families dealing with substance and
                  behavior problems." She suggests that such "Alternate
                  Facts" work to "put you off balance," "control the
                  story," and "make you think you're crazy," and she notes
                  that "presenting alternate facts is the hallmark of

                  <b>The Appeal to Closure</b>: The contemporary fallacy
                  that an argument, standpoint, action or conclusion no

                  else the point will remain unsettled, which is
                  unthinkable because those affected will be denied
                  "closure." This fallacy falsely reifies a specialized
                  term (closure) from Gestalt Psychology while refusing to
                  recognize the undeniable truth that some points will
                  indeed remain open and unsettled, perhaps forever. E.g.,
                  "Society would be protected, real punishment would be
                  inflicted, crime would be deterred and
                  justice served if we sentenced you to life without

                  extremely dangerous fallacy (a deluded argument from
                  ethos) that of claiming to know the mind of God (or History, or a higher
                  power), who has allegedly ordered or anointed, supports or approves of

                  Scripture, or Manifest Destiny, or Fate, or Heaven] has given it to us

                  fallacy of ethos (that of "Mother Nature") that if
                  something is "natural" it has to be good, healthy and
                  beneficial.&nbsp; E.g., "Our premium herb tea is

                  T. Radicans leaves. Those who dismiss it as mere 'Poison

                  employs or falls for this fallacy forgets the old truism
                  that left to itself, nature is indeed "red in tooth and
                  claw."&nbsp;This fallacy also applies to arguments alleging
                  that something is "unnatural," or "against nature" and
                  thus evil (<strong>The Argument from Natural Law</strong>) e.g. "Homosexuality should be outlawed

                  authority to define what is "natural" and what is
                  unnatural or perverted. E.g., during the American
                  Revolution British sources widely condemned rebellion
                  against King George III as "unnatural," and American
                  revolutionaries as "perverts," because the Divine Right
                  of Kings represented Natural Law, and according to
                  1 Samuel 15:23 in the Bible, rebellion is like unto
                  witchcraft.

                  Reformation was in large part a rejection of this
                  fallacy. When used knowingly and deliberately this

                  given subject or question this fact in itself proves the

                  admits it can tell us nothing about God, so you can't
                  deny that God exists!" Often misused in the American
                  justice system, where, contrary to the 5th Amendment and
                  the legal presumption of innocence until proven guilty,&nbsp;
                  remaining silent or "taking the Fifth" is often falsely
                  portrayed as proof of guilt. E.g., "Mr. Hixon can

                  choosing to remain silent in the face of a police

                  <strong>Availability Bias </strong> (also, Attention

                  at hand, particularly the first or last information

                  wider evidence that clearly exists but is not as easily
                  remembered or accessed. E.g., "We know from experience
                  that this doesn't work," when "experience" means the

                  reflexively sends one's audience into a snapping,
                  foaming-at-the-mouth feeding-frenzy. Any reasoned attempt to more
                  clearly identify, deconstruct
                  or challenge an opponent's "dog whistle"
                  appeal results in
                  puzzled confusion at best and wild, irrational fury at worst.
                  "Dog whistles" differ widely in different places,
                  moments
                  and cultural milieux, and
                  they change and lose or gain power so quickly that even recent historic texts
                  sometimes become extraordinarily difficult to interpret. A common
                  but sad instance of the fallacy of Dog Whistle Politics is that of&nbsp;
                  candidate "debaters" of differing political shades
                  simply blowing
                  a succession of discursive "dog whistles" at their audience instead of
                  addressing, refuting or even bothering to listen to each other's arguments,
                  a situation
                  resulting in contemporary (2017) allegations that the political Right and Left
                  in America are speaking "different
                  languages" when they are simply blowing different
                  "dog whistles." See also, Reductionism..</p>

                  and groomed, "shocking facts" and then prompted to
                  immediately "draw their own conclusions." E.g., "Crime

                  allowed to "come to their own conclusions" are generally
                  much more strongly convinced than those who are given
                  both evidence and conclusion up front. However, Dr.
                  William Lorimer points out that "The only rational
                  response to the non-argument is 'So what?' i.e. 'What do

                  proved it?'"&nbsp;Closely related (if not

                  Historically, this referred to a tactic used during the

                  Jesus, King of Kings, and not to the evil usurper

                  <strong>The "F-Bomb" </strong>(also Cursing;
                  Obscenity; Profanity). An adolescent fallacy of pathos,
                  attempting to defend or strengthen one's argument with gratuitous,
                  unrelated sexual, obscene, vulgar, crude or profane
                  language when such language does nothing to make an
                  argument stronger, other than perhaps to create a sense
                  of identity with certain young male "urban" audiences.
                  This fallacy also includes adding gratuitous sex scenes
                  or "adult" language to an otherwise unrelated novel or
                  movie, sometimes simply to avoid the dreaded "G" rating. Related to this fallacy is the <strong>Salacious Fallacy</strong>,
                  falsely attracting attention to and thus potential
                  agreement with one's argument&nbsp;by inappropriately sexualizing it,
                  particularly connecting it to some form of sex that is
                  perceived as deviant, perverted or prohibited (E.g.,
                  Arguing against Bill Clinton's
                  presidential legacy by continuing to wave Monica's Blue Dress, or
                  against Donald Trump's presidency by obsessively highlighting his
                  past boasting about genital groping).
                  Historically, this dangerous fallacy was deeply implicated with the crime of
                  lynching, in which false, racist accusations against a Black
                  or minority victim were almost always salacious in nature
                  and the sensation involved was successfully used to
                  whip up public emotion to a murderous pitch. See also,

                  <b>The False Analogy</b>: The fallacy of incorrectly
                  comparing one thing to another in order to draw a false
                  conclusion. E.g., "Just like an alley cat needs to prowl,
                  a normal adult can’t be tied down to one single lover." The opposite of this fallacy is the <strong>
                    Sui Generis Fallacy</strong> (also, Differance), a postmodern stance that
                  rejects the validity of analogy and of inductive
                  reasoning altogether because any given person, place,
                  thing or idea under consideration is "sui generis" i.e.,

                  <b>Finish the Job:&nbsp; </b>The dangerous contemporary
                  fallacy, often aimed at a lesser-educated or working
                  class audience, that an action or standpoint (or the
                  continuation of that action or standpoint) may not be
                  questioned or discussed because there is "a job to be
                  done" or finished, falsely assuming "jobs" are meaningless but
                  never to be questioned. Sometimes those involved
                  internalize ("buy into") the "job" and make the task a
                  part of their own ethos.&nbsp; (E.g., "Ours is not to
                  reason why / Ours is but to do or die.") Related to this
                  is the "<strong>Just a Job"</strong> fallacy. (E.g.,
                  "How can torturers stand to look at themselves in the
                  mirror? But I guess it's OK because for them it's
                  just a job like any other, the job that they get paid to do.")&nbsp;&nbsp;

                  <strong>The Free Speech Fallacy:</strong> The infantile
                  fallacy of responding to challenges to one's statements
                  and standpoints by whining, "It's a free country, isn't
                  it?&nbsp; I can say anything I want to!" A contemporary case of this fallacy is the "<strong>Safe
                    Space,"</strong>
                  or<strong> "Safe Place," </strong>where it is not allowed to refute, challenge or even
                  discuss another's beliefs because that might be too
                  uncomfortable or "triggery" for emotionally fragile
                  individuals. E.g., "All I told him was, 'Jesus
                  loves the little children,'
                  but then he turned around and asked me 'But what about
                  birth defects?' That's <em>mean.</em>
                  I think I'm going to cry!"&nbsp;
                  <a href="http://billhd.com/">
                    Prof. Bill Hart Davidson</a> (2017) notes that
                  "Ironically, the most strident calls for 'safety' come
                  from those who want us to issue protections for
                  discredited ideas. Things that science doesn't support
                  AND that have destroyed lives - things like the inherent
                  superiority of one race over another. Those ideas wither
                  under demands for evidence. They *are* unwelcome. But
                  let's be clear: they are unwelcome because they have not
                  survived the challenge of scrutiny." Ironically, in
                  contemporary America "free speech" has often become
                  shorthand for freedom of racist, offensive or even
                  neo-Nazi expression, ideological trends that once in
                  power typically quash free speech.&nbsp;
                  Additionally, a recent (2017) scientific study has found
                  that, in fact, "<a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-09/bu-pth092717.php">people
                    think harder and produce better political arguments when
                    their views are challenged</a>" and not artificially
                  protected without challenge.

                  <strong>Gaslighting:</strong> A recently-prominent,
                  vicious fallacy of logic, denying or invalidating a person's own
                  knowledge and experiences by deliberately twisting or
                  distorting known facts, memories, scenes, events and
                  evidence in order to disorient a vulnerable opponent and
                  to make him or her doubt his/her sanity. E.g., "Who are
                  you going to believe?&nbsp; Me, or your own eyes?" Or,
                  "You claim you found me in bed with <em>her</em>?
                  Think again!&nbsp; You're crazy! You seriously need to see a
                  shrink." A very common, though cruel instance of
                  Gaslighting that seems to have been particularly familiar among mid-20th
                  century generations is the fallacy of <strong>Emotional
                    Invalidation</strong>, questioning, after the fact, the<strong>
                  </strong>reality or "validity" of&nbsp; affective
                  states, either another's or one's own. E.g., "Sure, I made it happen from beginning to end,
                  but but it wasn't <em>me</em> doing it, it was
                  just my stupid hormones betraying me." Or,
                  "You didn't really mean it when you said you
                  'hate' Mommy. Now take a time-out and you'll feel
                  better." Or, "No, you're not really in love; it's
                  just infatuation or 'puppy love.'" The fallacy of
                  "Gaslighting" is named after British playwright Patrick
                  Hamilton's 1938 stage play "Gas Light," also known as
                  "Angel Street."&nbsp; See also, Blind Loyalty, "The

                  <b>Guilt by Association:</b>
                  The fallacy of trying to refute or condemn someone's

                  <strong>Hero-Busting</strong> (also, "The Perfect is the

                  early example of this latter tactic is deftly described in
                  Robert Penn Warren's classic (1946) novel, <em>

                  employed at the service of the <strong>Identity Fallacy</strong> (see

                  E.g., In 1862 Abraham Lincoln said he was willing to settle the
                  U.S. Civil War either with or without freeing the slaves if it would preserve the Union, thus
                  "conclusively proving" that all whites are viciously racist
                  at heart and that
                  African Americans must do for self and never trust any

                  ye old forms and logic!"<strong>):</strong> A
                  corrupt postmodern argument from ethos, a variant on the
                  Argumentum ad Hominem in which the validity of one's
                  logic, evidence, experience or arguments depends not on
                  their own strength but rather on whether the one arguing
                  is a member of a given social class, generation,
                  nationality,
                  religious or ethnic
                  group, color, gender or sexual orientation, profession,
                  occupation or subgroup. In this fallacy, valid opposing
                  evidence and arguments are brushed aside or "othered" without comment
                  or consideration, as simply not worth arguing about
                  solely because of the lack of proper background or ethos
                  of the person making the argument, or because the one
                  arguing does not self-identify as a member of the
                  "in-group." E.g., "You'd understand me right away if you
                  were Burmese but since you're not there's no way I can
                  explain it to you," or "Nobody but another nurse can know what
                  a nurse has to go through." Identity fallacies are
                  reinforced by common<a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-05/afps-grc050517.php">
                    ritual,</a> language, and discourse. However, these
                  fallacies are occasionally self-interested, driven by
                  the egotistical ambitions of academics, politicians and
                  would-be group leaders anxious to build their own careers
                  by carving out a special identity group constituency to the exclusion&nbsp;
                  of existing broader-based identities and leadership. An
                  Identity Fallacy may lead to scorn or rejection of
                  potentially useful allies, real or prospective, because
                  they are not of one's own identity. The Identity Fallacy
                  promotes an exclusivist, sometimes cultish "do for self"
                  philosophy which in today's world virtually guarantees
                  self-marginalization and ultimate defeat.&nbsp; A recent
                  application of the Identity Fallacy is the fallacious
                  accusation of "<strong>Cultural Appropriation," </strong>
                  in which those who are not of the right Identity are
                  condemned for "appropriating" the cuisine, clothing,
                  language or music of a marginalized group, forgetting
                  the old axiom that "Imitation is the sincerest form
                  of flattery." Accusations of Cultural Appropriation
                  very often stem from competing selfish economic
                  interests (E.g., "What right do those p*nche
                  Gringos have to set up a&nbsp; taco place right here on

                  knows full well to be guilty. This latter is a common
                  practice in American jurisprudence, and is sometimes

                  <strong>Measurability: </strong>A corrupt argument from
                  logos and ethos<strong> </strong>(that of science and
                  mathematics), the modern Fallacy of Measurability
                  proposes that if something cannot be measured,
                  quantified and replicated it does not exist, or is "nothing but
                  anecdotal, touchy-feely stuff" unworthy of serious
                  consideration, i.e., mere gossip or subjective opinion.
                  Often, achieving "Measurability" necessarily demands preselecting, "fiddling" or
                  "massaging" the available data simply in order to make it statistically tractable, or
                  in order to support a desired conclusion. Scholar Thomas Persing thus describes
                  "The modernist fallacy of falsely and inappropriately applying norms, standardizations,
                  and data point requirements to quantify productivity or success. This is similar to
                  complex question, measurability, and oversimplification fallacies where the
                  user attempts to categorize complicated / diverse topics into terms that
                  when measured, suit their position. For example, the calculation of
                  inflation in the United States doesn't include the changes in the price to
                  gasoline, because the price of gasoline is too volatile, despite the fact
                  gasoline is necessary for most people to live their lives in the United
                  States." See also, "A Priori Argument," "Lying with Statistics," and the "Procrustean Fallacy."

                  <strong>Mind-reading </strong>(Also, "The Fallacy of Speculation;" "I
                  can read you like a book"): An ancient fallacy, a
                  corruption of stasis theory, speculating about someone
                  else's thoughts, emotions, motivations and "body
                  language" and then claiming to understand these clearly,
                  sometimes more accurately than the person in question
                  knows themselves. The rhetor deploys this phony
                  "knowledge" as a fallacious warrant for or against a
                  given standpoint. Scholar Myron Peto offers as an
                  example the baseless claim that “Obama doesn’t a da**
                  [sic] for human rights.” Assertions that "call for
                  speculation" are rightly rejected as fallacious in
                  U.S. judicial proceedings but far too often pass
                  uncontested in public discourse. The opposite of this
                  fallacy is the postmodern fallacy of <strong>Mind
                    Blindness</strong>
                  (also, the <strong>Autist's Fallacy</strong>), a
                  complete denial of any normal human capacity for "Theory of
                  Mind," postulating the utter incommensurability and
                  privacy of minds and thus the impossibility of ever
                  knowing or truly understanding another's thoughts,
                  emotions, motivations or intents. This fallacy, much
                  promoted by the late postmodernist guru Jacques Derrida,
                  necessarily vitiates any form of Stasis Theory. However,
                  the Fallacy of Mind Blindness has been
                  decisively refuted in

                  <strong>Moral Licensing: </strong>The contemporary
                  ethical fallacy that one's consistently moral life, good
                  behavior or recent extreme suffering or sacrifice earns
                  him/her the right to commit an immoral act without
                  repercussions, consequences or punishment. E.g., "I've

                  "After what I've been through, God knows I need this."&nbsp;
                  The fallacy of Moral Licensing is also sometimes applied

                  <strong>Moral Superiority </strong>(also, Self
                  Righteousness; the Moral High Ground):&nbsp; An ancient, immoral and extremely
                  dangerous fallacy, enunciated in Thomistic / Scholastic
                  philosophy in the late Middle Ages, arguing that Evil
                  has no rights that the Good and the Righteous are bound
                  to respect. That way lies torture, heretic-burning, and the Spanish
                  Inquisition. Those who practice this vicious fallacy reject any
                  "moral equivalency" (i.e., even-handed treatment)
                  between themselves (the Righteous) and their enemies
                  (the Wicked), against whom anything is fair, and to whom
                  nothing must be conceded, not even the right to life.
                  This fallacy is a specific denial of the ancient "Golden
                  Rule," and has been the cause of endless intractable
                  conflict, since if one is Righteous no negotiation with
                  Evil and its minions is possible; The only imaginable
                  road to a "just" peace is through total victory, i.e.,
                  the absolute defeat and liquidation of one's Wicked
                  enemies.&nbsp; American folk singer and Nobel Laureate
                  Bob Dylan expertly demolishes this fallacy in his 1963

                  <strong>Mortification</strong> (also, Live as Though
                  You're Dying; Pleasure-hating; No Pain No Gain): An
                  ancient fallacy of logos, trying to "beat the flesh into
                  submission" by extreme exercise or ascetic practices, deliberate
                  starvation or infliction of pain, denying the undeniable
                  fact that discomfort and pain exist for the purpose of
                  warning of lasting damage to the body. Extreme examples
                  of this fallacy are various forms of self-flagellation
                  such as practiced by the New Mexico "<em>Penitentes</em>"
                  during Holy Week or by Shia devotees during Muharram.
                  More familiar contemporary manifestations of this fallacy
                  are extreme "insanity" exercise regimes not intended for
                  normal health, fitness or competitive purposes but just
                  to "toughen" or "punish" the body. Certain
                  pop-nutritional theories and diets seem based on this
                  fallacy as well. Some contemporary experts suggest that
                  self-mortification (an English word related to the Latinate French
                  root "mort," or "death.") is in fact "suicide on the
                  installment plan." Others suggest that it involves a
                  narcotic-like addiction to the body's natural
                  endorphins. The opposite of this fallacy is the ancient
                  fallacy of<strong>
                    Hedonism</strong>, seeking and valuing physical pleasure
                  as a good in itself, simply for its own sake.

                  (also "What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas;" "I Think

                  public discussion of the problem and focusing on

                  that this would somehow reward evil-doers if we
                  recognize their deeds as real or consequential. Often
                  the underlying theory is that the situation is
                  "temporary" and will soon be reversed. E.g., In the
                  decades from 1949 until Richard Nixon's presidency the
                  United States officially refused to recognize the
                  existence of the most populous nation on earth, the
                  People's Republic of China, because America supported
                  the U.S.-friendly Republic of China government on Taiwan
                  instead and hoped they might somehow return to power on
                  the mainland.&nbsp;Perversely, in 2016 the U.S.
                  President-Elect caused a significant international flap
                  by chatting with the President of the government on
                  Taiwan, a de facto violation of long-standing American
                  non-recognition of that same regime. More than half a
                  century after the Korean War the U.S. still refuses to
                  pronounce the name of, or recognize (much less conduct
                  normal,
                  peaceful negotiations with) a nuclear-armed DPRK
                  (North Korea). An individual who practices this fallacy risks
                  institutionalization (e.g., "I refuse to recognize Mom's

                  (also, "The Nose Knows"): A vicious, zoological-level

                  first they go home and take a bath!" Or, "I can smell a

                  cuisines, e.g., "I don't care what they say or do, their

                  real accent, dialect, or lack of fluency in standard
                  English, e.g., "He told me 'Vee vorkers need to form a

                  <strong>The Passive Voice Fallacy </strong>(also, the
                  Bureaucratic Passive): A fallacy from ethos, concealing
                  active human agency behind the curtain of the grammatical
                  passive voice, e.g., "It has been decided that you
                  are to be let go," arrogating an ethos of cosmic infallibility
                  and inevitability to a very fallible conscious decision
                  made by identifiable, fallible and potentially culpable human beings.
                  Scholar Jackson Katz notes (2017): "We talk about how
                  many women were raped last year, not about how many men
                  raped women. We talk about how many girls in a school
                  district were harassed last year, not about how many
                  boys harassed girls. We talk about how many teenage
                  girls in the state of Vermont got pregnant last year,
                  rather than how many men and boys impregnated teenage
                  girls. ...&nbsp; So you can see how the use of the
                  passive voice has a political effect. [It] shifts the
                  focus off of men and boys and onto girls and women. Even
                  the term 'Violence against women' is problematic. It's a
                  passive construction; there's no active agent in the
                  sentence. It's a bad thing that happens to women, but
                  when you look at the term 'violence against women'
                  nobody is doing it to them, it just happens to them...
                  Men aren't even a part of it."&nbsp; See also, Political
                  Correctness. An obverse of the Passive Voice Fallacy is the <strong>Be-verb Fallacy</strong>,
                  a cultish linguistic theory and the bane of many a first-year composition student's life,
                  alleging that an extraordinary degree of "clarity," "sanity,"
                  or textual "liveliness" can be reached by strictly eliminating all passive verb forms
                  and all forms of the verb "to be" from English-language writing. This odd but unproven
                  contention, dating back to Alfred Korzybski's "General Semantics"
                  self-improvement movement of the 1920's and '30's via S. I. Hayakawa,
                  blithely ignores the fact that although numerous major world languages
                  lack a ubiquitous "be-verb," e.g., Russian, Hindi and Arabic,
                  speakers of these languages, like English-speaking General Semantics devotees themselves,
                  have never been proven to enjoy any particular cognitive advantage
                  over ordinary everyday users of the passive voice and the verb "to be."
                  Nor have writers of the curiously stilted English that results from applying this fallacy
                  achieved any special success in academia, professional or technical writing, or in the popular domain. </p>

                  fallacy, supposing that the nature of a thing or
                  situation can be changed by simply changing its name.
                  E.g., "Today we strike a blow for animal rights and

                  ‘pets’ to ‘animal companions.’" Or "Never, ever play the

                  political "<strong>Language Control,"</strong> e.g.,
                  being careful <em>never</em>
                  to refer to North Korea or ISIS/ISIL by their rather
                  pompous proper names ("the Democratic People's Republic
                  of Korea" and "the Islamic State," respectively) or to
                  the Syrian government as the "Syrian government," (It's
                  always the "Regime" or the "Dictatorship.").
                  Occasionally the fallacy of "Political Correctness" is
                  falsely confused with simple courtesy, e.g., "I'm sick
                  and tired of the tyranny of Political Correctness, having to
                  watch my words all the time--I want to be free to speak

                  "The Projection Bias," "They're Just Like Us," "Singing 'Kumbaya.'"):&nbsp;
                  A traditional, often tragic fallacy of ethos, that of
                  automatically (and falsely) assuming that everyone else
                  in any given place, time and circumstance had or has
                  basically the same (positive) wishes, desires,
                  interests, concerns, ethics and moral code as "we" do.
                  This fallacy practically if not theoretically denies
                  both the reality of difference and the human capacity to
                  chose radical evil.&nbsp; E.g., arguing that "The only
                  thing most Nazi Storm Troopers wanted was the same thing
                  we do, to live in peace and prosperity and to have a
                  good family life," when the reality was radically
                  otherwise. Dr. William Lorimer offers this explanation:
                  "<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">The Projection Bias is
                    the flip side of the 'They're Not Like Us' [Othering]
                    fallacy. The Projection bias (fallacy) is 'They're just
                    people like me, therefore they must be motivated by the
                    same things that motivate me.' For example: 'I would
                    never pull a gun and shoot a police officer unless I was
                    convinced he was trying to murder me; therefore, when
                    Joe Smith shot a police officer, he must have been in
                    genuine fear for his life.' I see the same fallacy with
                    regard to Israel: 'The people of Gaza just want to be
                    left in peace; therefore, if Israel would just lift the
                    blockade and allow Hamas to import anything they want,
                    without restriction, they would stop firing rockets at
                    Israel.' That may or may not be true - I personally
                    don't believe it - but the argument clearly presumes
                    that the people of Gaza, or at least their leaders, are
                    motivated by a desire for peaceful co-existence." </span>
                  The Pollyanna Principle was gently but expertly
                  demolished in the classic twentieth-century American
                  animated cartoon series, "The Flintstones," in which the
                  humor lay in the absurdity of picturing "Stone Age"
                  characters having the same concerns, values and
                  lifestyles as mid-twentieth century white working class
                  Americans.&nbsp; This is the opposite of the Othering
                  fallacy. (Note: The Pollyanna Principle fallacy should
                  not be confused with a psychological principle of the

                  innocent children on all sides usually suffer the most

                  inappropriately and most often offensively applying sports,
                  gaming, hunting or other recreational
                  imagery to unrelated areas of life, such as war
                  or intimacy. E.g., "Nope, I haven't scored with Francis

                  soaked in testosterone and machismo. An associated

                  <strong>The Standard Version Fallacy:</strong>&nbsp; The
                  ancient fallacy, a discursive Argumentum ad Baculum, of choosing a "Standard Translation" or
                  "Authorized Version" of an&nbsp; ancient or sacred text
                  and arbitrarily declaring it "correct" and
                  "authoritative," necessarily eliminating much of the
                  poetry and underlying meaning of the original but
                  conveniently quashing any further discussion about the meaning of the
                  original text, e.g., the Vulgate or The King James
                  Version. The easily demonstrable fact that translation
                  (beyond three or four words) is neither uniform nor
                  reversible (i.e., never comes back exactly the same when
                  retranslated from another language) gives the lie to any
                  efforts to make translation of human languages into an
                  exact science. Islam clearly recognizes this fallacy
                  when characterizing any attempt to translate the sacred
                  text of the Holy Qur'an out of the original Arabic as a
                  "paraphrase" at very best. An obverse of this fallacy is
                  the <strong>Argumentum ad Mysteriam</strong>, above.&nbsp; An extension of the
                  Standard Version Fallacy is the <strong>Monolingual
                    Fallacy</strong>, at an academic level the fallacy of
                  ignorantly assuming (as a monolingual person) that
                  transparent, in-depth translation between languages is
                  the norm, or even possible at all, allowing one to
                  conveniently and falsely ignore everyday
                  issues of translation when close-reading translated literature
                  or
                  academic text and theory. At the popular level the Monolingual
                  Fallacy allows monolinguals to blithely demand that
                  visitors, migrants, refugees and newcomers learn
                  English, either before arriving or else overnight after
                  arrival in the United States, while applying no such
                  demand to themselves when they go to Asia, Europe, Latin
                  America, or even French-speaking areas of Canada. Not
                  rarely, this fallacy descends into gross racism or
                  ethnic discrimination, e.g., the demagogy of warning of

                  will perceive a mass media message to have more
                  influence on others, than themselves. This perception
                  tends to counteract the message's intended
                  'call-to-action.' Basically, this suggests that over

                  <b>Tu Quoque </b>("You Do it Too!"; also, Two Wrongs
                  Make a Right): A corrupt argument from ethos, the
                  fallacy of defending a shaky or false standpoint or
                  excusing one's own bad action by pointing out that one's
                  opponent's acts, ideology or personal character are also
                  open to question, or are perhaps even worse than one's
                  own. E.g., "Sure, we may have tortured prisoners and
                  killed kids with drones, but we don't cut off heads
                  like they do!" Or, "You can't stand there and accuse me
                  of corruption! You guys are all into politics and you
                  know what we have to do to get reelected!"&nbsp;
                  Unusual, self-deprecating variants on this fallacy are<strong> </strong>
                  the<strong> Ego / Nos Quoque</strong> Fallacies ("I / we do
                  it too!"), minimizing or defending another's evil actions
                  because I am / we are guilty of the same thing&nbsp; or of
                  even worse. E.g., In response to allegations that&nbsp;
                  Russian Premier Vladimir Putin is a "killer," American
                  President Donald Trump (2/2017) told an interviewer,
                  "There are a lot of killers. We've got a lot of killers.
                  What, do you think our country's so innocent?"&nbsp;
                  This fallacy is related
                  to the Red Herring and to the Ad Hominem Argument.</p>

                  corrupt and dangerous fallacy of logos and ethos, first
                  formally described in medieval times but still common
                  today, holding that there exists one "truth" in one
                  given environment (e.g., in science, work or school) and
                  simultaneously a different, formally contradictory but
                  equally true "truth" in a different epistemic system,
                  context, environment, intended audience or discourse community (e.g., in
                  one's religion or at home). This can lead to a situation
                  of stable cognitive dissonance where, as UC Irvine
                  scholar Dr. Carter T. Butts describes it (2016), "I know
                  but don't believe," making rational discussion difficult,
                  painful
                  or impossible.&nbsp;This fallacy also describes the discourse
                  of politicians who cynically proclaim one "truth" as
                  mere "campaign rhetoric" used "to mobilize the base," or
                  "for domestic consumption only," and a quite different
                  and contradictory "truth" for more general or practical
                  purposes once in office.&nbsp; See also Disciplinary

                  and uncensored opinion about the matter in question.
                  This same fallacy applies to minimizing, denying the

                  <strong>Venue: </strong>The ancient fallacy of Venue, a corrupt argument from kairos,
                  falsely and arbitrarily invalidates an otherwise-valid argument
                  or piece of evidence because it is supposedly offered in the wrong place,
                  at the wrong moment or in an inappropriate court, medium or forum. According
                  to PhD student Amanda Thran, "Quite often, people will say to me in person that Facebook, Twitter, etc. are 'not the right forums'
                  for discussing politically and socially sensitive issues. ... In this same vein, I’ve also encountered the following
                  argument: 'Facebook, which is used for sharing wedding, baby, and pet photos, is an inappropriate place
                  for political discourse; people don’t wished to be burdened with that when they log in.' In my experience,
                  this line of reasoning is most often employed (and abused) to shut down a conversation when one feels they
                  are losing it. Ironically, I have seen it used when the argument has already been transpiring on the platform
                  [in] an already lengthy discussion." See also Disciplinary Blinders.
