Better ways than traditional polling methods


Retrieve new data from server in a fixed amount of seconds
Assume that
  - this is quite taxing
  - does not retrieve latest result immediately
  - the server is using ASMX for webservice functions
  - can not do any major overhaul
  
How do you improve on the application efficiency?
